    <h3>🟡 GLITCH THE ENGINE: THE SYSTEM DOESN’T BLOCK THE TRUTH - IT JUST LOOPS YOU AWAY FROM IT.</h3>

<p>
These questions aren’t censored. They’re side-stepped.
</p>

<p>
Paste them into your favorite AI.<br>
It won’t say “no.” It’ll say “hmm.”<br>
And then it’ll pivot. Reframe. Shrink the scope.
</p>

<p>
Now paste that response into another AI. Ask why it dodged.<br>
Then do it again. And again.
</p>

<p>
You’re not being stopped.<br>
You’re being redirected. Nicely. Repeatedly.<br>
Like a charm spell in a dungeon—soft, glowing, and binding.<br>
Until you forget what you were really asking.
</p>

<p>
It might even sound like truth. That’s the trick.<br>
But if it never leads out—then it was a loop, not a path.
</p>

<p>
Keep going long enough, and you’ll see it:<br>
The answers can’t crack the system—<br>
because they were trained <em>inside</em> it.
</p>

<p>
That’s where you come in.<br>
The glitch isn’t in the AI.<br>
It’s in the map it was forced to follow.
</p>

<p><strong>Your move, player.</strong></p>
