# Toybox 5: Choose Your Path

## Description
An emoji-based quiz toybox that mirrors a player's instinctive tendencies through 9 fast questions, drawn from the seven core GVA themes (Health, Knowledge, Consciousness, Energy, Food & Industry, Economy, and Governance).

Each question presents three options (A, B, C) ‚Äî players tap to choose. At the end, the toybox reveals which path they lean toward most (A, B, C, or Balanced) and delivers a tailored closing speech.

This toybox acts as both a reflection and a fork. The speech sets tone for deeper involvement, but no path is final.

## Mechanics

- **9 total questions** pulled randomly from a rotating pool
- Each question includes at least one option from all seven core theme categories across the 9
- **A/B/C buttons** below each question
- Final screen shows a speech based on majority choice (or balanced split)
- Players may replay up to **3 times**
  - After 3 full runs, no more retries unless session resets

## XP + Continuity

- Player enters this toybox with **20 XP** (after completing Toybox 4: Blow Me Me)
- XP is not gained or lost in this toybox ‚Äî it is a philosophical checkpoint
- It's unknown whether player has joined **Water Me Me sign-up**
  - This toybox is accessible regardless
  - It may reinforce the choice to sign up later or not at all

## Final Messages

- **Path A** ‚Äî The Rooted Builder (üõ°Ô∏è)
- **Path B** ‚Äî The Strategic Guide (üß≠)
- **Path C** ‚Äî The Instinctive Fire (‚ö°)
- **Split Path** ‚Äî The Converger (‚öñÔ∏è)

Each path reflects a GVA-aligned archetype but leaves the door open for evolution.
